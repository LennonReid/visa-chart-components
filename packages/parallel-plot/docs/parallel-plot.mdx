# Parallel Plot

<p className="sub-header-p">Displays multiple series over multiple categories or periods of time. The slope of the line represents the difference in value between the each pair of categories or periods in time.</p>

<!-- ## Why should I use it?

- Bar charts allow for precise comparisons across groups or data points
- Allow for comparisons of discrete numeric values over time
- A well-recognized chart that your audience will likely have experience working with

## What should I watch out for?

- If a large number of values are sorted in descending order it may be hard to see smaller values
- Be sure that your numeric scale always starts at zero – when you are comparing length of a bar it’s important that the actual length of the bar is proportional to the value on the scale -->
