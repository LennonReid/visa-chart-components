# Dumbbell Plot

<p className="sub-header-p">Visualizes two series of data by showing the distance between both numeric values at each point in time or category</p>

import { Story } from '@storybook/addon-docs';

<Story id="dumbbell-plot--hidden" />

<!-- ## Why should I use it?

- Bar charts allow for precise comparisons across groups or data points
- Allow for comparisons of discrete numeric values over time
- A well-recognized chart that your audience will likely have experience working with

## What should I watch out for?

- If a large number of values are sorted in descending order it may be hard to see smaller values
- Be sure that your numeric scale always starts at zero – when you are comparing length of a bar it’s important that the actual length of the bar is proportional to the value on the scale -->
