# Clustered Bar Chart

<p className="sub-header-p">A variation of bar charts, clustered bar charts also use the length of rectangular bars to proportionally represent data, but in this chart type bars are grouped based on a broader category</p>

import { Story } from '@storybook/addon-docs';

<Story id="clustered-bar-chart--hidden" />

<!-- ## Why should I use it?

- Allow for precise comparisons within groups
- Can be used to visualize differences within groups over time or across groups

## What should I watch out for?

- Not an ideal way to compare across groups
- Groups that contain many bars can appear cluttered and hard to understand -->
